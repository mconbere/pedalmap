Variables:

	Distance from beacon (1 meter?)
	Time stopped for end of ride (maybe doesn't matter if beacon distance is awesome)

Features:

	Auto upload to strava?

Registering beacons logic:

	Configure based on UUID/major minor number to register bike. Give it a name?

Tracking rides logic:

				if (beacon in range and in close proximity) {
					start tracking location.
				}

				while (tracking location AND beacon in range) {
					if (moving) {
						record GPS path traveled.
					}
				}

				if (no movement for long time OR beacon no longer in range) {
					mark as bike ride.
				}

Statistics to play with:
- # rides
- Total distance
- Avg distance per ride
- Total time
- Avg time per ride
- Weather during rides
- When do people ride bikes? If it rains, how much does it change?
- Time of day (commuting data)
